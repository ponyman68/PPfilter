# PPfilter
Userscript for filtering images on 4chan /mlp/ by data-md5.

Works on any board, just adjust the url.

The repository includes approximately 10k hand-picked MD5 with barby content. Also included is a text file with links to approximately 180k more MD5s of offending content.

# Usage

Install the userscript and navigate to /mlp/. Every image has a hide/show button. On the top right of the page is a button with import/export options for your local MD5 database. You can copy/paste the urls or files from this repository in there to fill your database.
